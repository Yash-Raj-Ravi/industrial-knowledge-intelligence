# Industrial Knowledge Intelligence Platform

An AI-powered platform for industrial document intelligence, semantic knowledge retrieval, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using locally hosted AI models.

---

## Problem Statement

Industrial organizations manage thousands of documents such as operating procedures, maintenance manuals, inspection reports, safety guidelines, and technical documentation. Finding accurate information quickly is difficult because these documents are often distributed across multiple systems and formats.

This project aims to build an intelligent AI platform that indexes industrial documents, performs semantic search, and answers user questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Current Features

### Document Processing

- Multi-format document upload
- PDF parsing using PyMuPDF
- TXT parsing
- CSV parsing
- DOCX parsing
- PPTX parsing
- XLSX parsing

### AI Processing Pipeline

- Document chunking using a sliding window approach
- Local embedding generation using Ollama (`mxbai-embed-large`)
- Batch embedding generation
- Persistent vector storage with ChromaDB
- Semantic similarity search
- Metadata-preserving document indexing

### Backend API

- File upload endpoint
- Document parsing endpoint
- Chunk generation endpoint
- Embedding generation endpoint
- Semantic search endpoint
